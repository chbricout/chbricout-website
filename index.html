      About Me
     </h3>
     <p>
      I’m currently a master’s student in Computer Science at
      <em>
       École de Technologie Supérieure (ETS)
      </em>
      and Mila in Montréal, working in the Neuro-iX lab. At the same time, I’m also completing a
      <em>
       Diplôme d’ingénieur
      </em>
      (equivalent to a combined BS/MS) at
      <em>
       Université de Technologie de Compiègne
      </em>
      / Sorbonne Alliance in France, with a specialization in AI and Data Science. I am looking for PhD opportunities in Sustainable / Efficient AI.
     </p>
     <p>
      My research, under the supervision of Sylvain Bouix and Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, focuses on automating brain MRI quality control using deep learning. Specifically, I’m working on detecting and quantifying motion artifacts in 3D T1-weighted brain MRIs. It’s a tricky challenge due to limited data and the high memory demand of training convolutional neural networks on 3D volumes.

      Research Interests
     </h3>
     <p>
      Beyond the medical space, I’m also passionate about Open Science and making AI more sustainable. Right now, deep learning is often data-inefficient, power-hungry, and behaves like a black box. Plus, designing or scaling models is painfully hard with loads of hyperparameters to try. I think there’s huge potential in improving our methods and exploring alternative approaches like Gaussian Processes. These are the topics I’d love to dive into during a PhD.

     <p>
      Outside the lab, I stay pretty active in the community. I’m part of ETS’s music club where I sing and play bass in two bands—one pop/jazz and one indie rock. I’m also leading the project to create a sustainable, zero-waste student coffee shop at ETS.
     </p>
     <p>
      As a project manager in ETS’s sustainable committee,
      <a href="https://tributerre.neocities.org/">
       Tributerre
      </a>
      , I redesigned our old, resource-heavy Wix website with a lightweight, eco-friendly version that’s currently hosted on Neocities. We’re planning to host it on a Raspberry Pi Zero powered by an unused solar panel from one of the labs at ETS. As a member of the student association, I’ve also been pushing for the use of sewable patches instead of T-shirts for clubs and associations to help reduce waste.

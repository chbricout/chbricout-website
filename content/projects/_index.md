### Current Personal Projects (More on [GitHub](https://github.com/chbricout))

- [Lighterre](https://github.com/chbricout/Lighterre): A lightweight website for the sustainable development committee *Tributerre*. Weâ€™re building a list of vegetarian recipes, so feel free to send any you like to my email!

- [Hugo Sizer](https://github.com/chbricout/hugo-sizer): A Python CLI tool to compute and insert full page weight (including media, scripts, stylesheets, etc.) for static Hugo websites. I developed this for my personal website and the *Lighterre* project.

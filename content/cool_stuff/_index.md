### Low Tech Web

Here are some interesting links related to low-tech web and sustainability:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/): A static website generator written in Go (used for this website).
- [Marginalia](https://search.marginalia.nu/): A search engine to find obscure and small websites.
- [Dither Me This](https://doodad.dev/dither-me-this/): A really cool image dithering program.
- [LowTech and IT](https://lownum.fr/): A French project led by a teacher from *Université de Technologie de Compiègne*.
- [Website Carbon](https://www.websitecarbon.com/): A tool to estimate the carbon emissions of your websites.

### Climate Workshop

I enjoy (and recommend) the [different Fresk workshops](https://wiki.climatefresk.org/?title=Les_fresques_amies), with the most well-known being the [Climate Fresk](https://climatefresk.org/world/). I’ve also participated in the Planetary Frontier's, *Numérique*'s (digital), and Biodiversity's Fresks, which are also excellent (though currently available only in French). Additionally, I had a fun and educational time with the [2 Tons workshop](https://en.2tonnes.org/), which helped me understand how I can aim to reach 2 tons of CO2 emissions by 2050 on a personal level.

### Climate Games

Here are a few fun games that help educate about climate urgency:
